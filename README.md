# Adam's Website

My new website made in NextJS. Try it out [here](https://beta.adamxu.net/)!

Build it yourself:

```
git clone https://github.com/adamexu/adams-website.git
cd adams-website
npm install
npm run dev
```

Note: `npm build` does not work right now. I'm hoping to fix that before I go create another website (hehe) AND without the help of ChatGPT (ChatGPT just shittifies my code)

Note 2: Yes, I used a lot of AI for this. It involved a lot of screaming at ChatGPT because I couldn't figure out ESLint and all that other NextJS stuff. It is with a heavy heart that I must inform that I still cannot NextJS without the help of AI. My next project will (hopefully) be AI free.
